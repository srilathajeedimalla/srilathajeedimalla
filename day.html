    <p><b>Lakshmibai Newalkar</b>, the <b>Rani of Jhansi</b> (pronunciationⓘ; <br>born <b>Manikarnika Tambe</b>; 19 November 1828 — 18 June <br>1858),[1][2] was the Maharani consort of the princely state of Jhansi<br> in Maratha Empire from 1843 to 1853 by marriage to Maharaja<br> Gangadhar Rao Newalkar. She was one of the leading figures in <br>the Indian Rebellion of 1857, who became a national hero and <br>symbol of resistance to the British rule in India for Indian <br>nationalists.<br>

        Born into a Karhada Brahmin family in Banares, Lakshmibai<br> married the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao, in 1842. When<br> the Maharaja died in 1853, the British East India Company under<br> Governor-General Lord Dalhousie refused to recognize the claim of<br> his adopted heir and annexed Jhansi under the Doctrine of Lapse.<br> The Rani was unwilling to cede control and joined the rebellion<br> against the British in 1857. She led the successful defense of<br> Jhansi against Company allies, but in early 1858 Jhansi fell to<br> British forces under the command of Hugh Rose. The Rani<br> managed to escape on horseback and joined the rebels in<br> capturing Gwalior, where they proclaimed Nana Saheb as Peshwa <br>of the revived Maratha Empire. She died in June 1858 after being<br> mortally wounded during the British counterattack at Gwalior.
